As I progressed during my Coding journey, I found javascript is a much more functional and opened up language comparing C++ and Java. For example, indentations on javascript seem to be running just fine without strict proper spacing. As well as, the strings and numbers could work together without too many hassles in a function. Javascript experience has always been friendly to me since high school. Iâ€™ve took a coding class in high school that I was introduced to the world of programming for the first time. I found my self enjoy the simple coding that I was capable of doing. That semester of experience really ignited me on building myself to become one of a programmers. On the Es6, I found it interesting how you are able to destructure Es5 syntax turning it in another way for the function. One thing I really enjoy javascript are the capability of working with HTML and CSS. Javascript function is something that is unique about this language, function beening called out really felt like puting pieces of puzzle together to get things running. Which really reflect on the way we would have to communicate with people to work together putting pieces together to accomplish the project or software.

In my opinion, WODs really helped us gathering our brain to warm back up from the year of not coding. WODs are useful to test our knowledge on the things we know and provide us the tricks that sometimes gives us the whooa moment. I do enjoy how WODs are working for us, it is also a stress on us when we are getting timed. Solving for WODs is fun when we could get the answer, however, it is really competitive while being watched by others if we aren't able to obtain the answer within the time range.I think this style of learning will work as competition are always everywhere once we started to apply for jobs.

During this semester, I do hope to achieve a project that could help me grow as a job-ready programmer. Working on projects to help us develop the skill needed in the job could be one of the things I would like to acquire. Building my profile for my future are also something I would like to be done in this class. So far, I have enjoyed this class as I really feel this class is helping me on the way for the long run.
