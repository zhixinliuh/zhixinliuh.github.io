The “Gang of Four”, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides introduced the twenty-three design pattern in the book “Design patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.”While there are twenty-three design patterns presented, there are mainly three types of design patterns. Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Each type has its uniqueness. While I was working on my project, I believed the Observer design pattern is what makes the most out of my working part in the project. Updating one-page data will pop the popcorn to update the rest of the page on the website, which is an example of an Observers Design Pattern.

 While Design Patterns are more like a powerful tool or template for the software developers to fix issues that have occurred in history, it's best to understand its concept. Model View Controller is one of the design patterns we used in our meteor application. For example, the Model in Meteor would act like a MongoDB database, and the view would be Blaze, and the controller would be FlowRouter. In my application code for the meteor, the Model would be the collections. The view would be the template and pages within my applications. The controller would be FlowRouter in the import/startup/client folder.
