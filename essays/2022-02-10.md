Coding Standards are difficult to follow, especially when there are many different coding languages to learn. Things like indentation or spaces are hard to keep track of while working with other languages in a short period. I also think some coding standards are pretty unnecessary. It only gets the programmer to waste time on minor issues instead of focusing on the program itself for results.

However, on the other hand, I do think it does help with the early stage of learning languages. Coding Standards helps us break down the code by setting its own rule. Just like learning English, you would have to know the spelling and grammar to communicate correctly and efficiently to others.

After the first week of using ESlint with Intellij, the green checkmark is quite helpful. At first, ESlint did cost more trouble than good to me. However, as I progress and start to fix my code with the errors generated, I begin to notice the mistake before the ESlint pops up. With the use of such coding standards, I will improve my coding with quality coding outcomes.
