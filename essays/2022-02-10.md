  Coding Standards are a harsh thing to follow. Especially when there are large amount of different coding languages to learn from. Things like indentation or spaces are hard to keep track of while working with different languages in a short period of time. I personally also think some coding standards are quite unnessary as it only gets the programmer to have time wasted on the little issues instead of focusing on the program it self for results.
  
  However,on the other hand I do think it does help with early stage of learning languages.Coding Standards helps us break down the code by setting its own rule. Just like learning english, you would have to know the spelling and grammers to communicate correctly and efficiently to others.
  
  After the first week of using ESlint with Intellij, I found that the green checkmark is quite helpful. At first, ESlint did cost more trouble then good to me. However, as I progress and starting to fix my code with the errors generated, I starts to notice the error before the ESlint pops up. I believe, with the use of such coding standards I will imporve on my coding with quality coding outcomes.
