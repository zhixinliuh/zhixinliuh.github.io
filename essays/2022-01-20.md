As most programer, I also like the feeling of puting pieces togather.While everything work out when you hit run, its the best moment for me.Design everything and making everything work feels like an accompelishment everytime of project. software enginnering creats convenience for everyone to advance and enjoy their daily life.

During the future, I hope i could develop more advance coding skill upon myself so I could get to be a part of something big in the future. looking forward to see that people are using an app that I created or be a part of.

During this semester, I do hope to achieve a project that could help me grow as a job-ready programmer. Working on projects to help us develop the skill needed in the job could be one of the things I would like to acquire. Building my profile for my future is also something I would like to be done in this class. So far, I have enjoyed this class as I really feel this class is helping me on the way to the long run.
