Like most programmers, I also like the feeling of putting pieces together. At the same time, everything works out when you hit run. It's the best moment for me. Designing everything and making everything work feels like an accomplishment for every project. Software engineering creates convenience for everyone to advance and enjoy their daily life.
I could develop more advanced coding skills myself to be a part of something big in the future. I am looking forward to seeing that people are using an app that I created or be a part of.
During this semester, I hope to achieve a project that could help me grow as a job-ready programmer. Working on projects to help us develop the skill needed in the job could be one of the things I would like to acquire. Building my profile for my future is also something I would like to be done in this class. So far, I have enjoyed this class as I feel this class is helping me on the way to the long run.
