<a href="https://walking-with-pele.github.io">Walking With Pele</a> is a Web development project that was created for the Final Project of my Software Engineering class.  Our project team members consist of Hyuman Tsuchiya, Joshua Rico, Kai He, Don Maddock, and myself. The goal of this project is to provide Uh Manoa students community to explore and share locations for a better experience in Oahu. This was a unique experience for all of us. This Final project concludes everything we learned throughout the semester and introduced to us the other layer of software Engineering. One thing I've learned in this project is the mindset, constructing the application with Team members in stages is significantly important. Communication with a team member is always a priority while working in a group. Consistently work with the group to the accommodation of goals and solutions to the problem we are dealing with.

Throughout the project, Our team was able to store the source code using GitHub for easy access and modifications to the project. The Project Boards assisted us with our issue management significantly, we were able to resolve issues and tasks for our project in an orderly manner. My main contribution to the project would be the styling part of the project. Providing logo designs and home page designs for better user experience surrounding UH Manoa-friendly web environment. Card styling ribbon was one of the elements I thought would be enlighting to members looking through the categories.
