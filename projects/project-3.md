summary: Monkey Jumping game developed from using Phaser framework.
---    
Phaser is an game framework that are used for making html games. With the help of phaser making html game was really convenient. To make a html game assets is an really important part, assets are the images in the game. Assets also helps to crate motions on characters.
With html games, the structure are mostly pieces of images adding up to a whole.

One interesting thing on phaser is the ability to add Physics which allows us to set up the characters with speed and gravitys that pulls the characters to land. For the game below when the character jumps it will land with the gravity value set on file. When the characters hit with the star the point goes up.
