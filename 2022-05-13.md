## Is there such thing as a stupid question?

While there might be not worthy answered questions, I believe that there are no stupid questions.As we are more advanced in technology, people are explored to more resources and help they are able to receive. This extra help and assistance that they could get for granted tend to get them lazier getting the answer they wanted. Easy answer questions often could be found answers with a bit of effort online. People who are been realized to ask lazy questions are replied with STFW and RTFM, to do some research before asking questions.

## What’s a smart question?

Determine if a question is smart or not is by the preparation that the person did. Asking questions online might be easy, However, a prepared question will receive more efficient answers. This leads to how most troubleshooting works, as you tend to find the issues, the more you break it down the easier you will find the error. In the end, even if you can't fix the error you will know what is mostly happening and the answer you receive will make a lot more sense.  Here are some things you should do before asking questions.

By Eric Steven Raymond:
Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.
Try to find an answer by searching the Web.
Try to find an answer by reading the manual.
Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.
Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.
Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.
If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.

When asking question:
Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.
Describe the environment in which it occurs (machine, OS, application, whatever). Provide your vendor's distribution and release level (e.g.: “Fedora Core 7”, “Slackware 9.1”, etc.).
Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question.
Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem yourself before you asked the question.
Describe any possibly relevant recent changes in your computer or software configuration.
If at all possible, provide a way to reproduce the problem in a controlled environment.

Here is an Example I found to be a smart question:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59478445/why-is-google-drive-returning-failed-to-parse-content-range-header
```
Q: Why is Google Drive returning 'Failed to parse Content-Range header.'?

Here's my simple-dimple code for resuming a (possibly) interrupted upload to Google Drive:

(Code in the link above)

but Google keeps on returning

Failed to parse Content-Range header.

I checked the header manually, and it seems ok:

Content-Range: bytes */389587456
Content-Length: 0
What may the matter be?

What I tried:

Using StringContent instead of ByteArrayContent

Using TryAddWithoutValidation with */*

Neither work

With appeciation,

UPDATE

I tried uploading a new file from scratch. Fresh upload. Here's the code:

(Code in the link above)

But i get the exact same response:Failed to parse Content-Range header.

This is after the entire file was uploaded (based on the time it takes to return, and the position of the filesteam)

Whats wrong with my request?

Thanks

For completeness, here's the entire code basically. I'd appreciate any help or pointers

(Code in the link above)

This question I found to be a smart question for several reasons. Starting off, the heading will need improvement on more effective and specific than why. Getting into the problem itself, makes me realize that this person did some research and attempt on solving the problem which shows me that he was serious that he needs help. The asker showed evidence on how he approached solving the issue using several different ideas as well as checking the code manually. The asker also provided an update on what he did next and the result it turned up to, this shows that he was really trying to solve its issue as much as he could. These types of smarter questions often could be easily determined by the more experienced personnel and get effective answers.

## The Lazy Question.

Here is the Lazy Question I found on Stack Overflow
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70889009/i-write-a-code-in-the-terminal-and-they-show-me-a-error
```
Q: I write a code in the Terminal and they show me a error

npm : The term 'npm' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again. At line:1 char:1

npm init
  + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (npm:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
  + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException

```
Starting with the heading, the heading contains with lack of information as well as low intensity on solving the issue. From this heading, we can tell that this asker just wanted answers to solve the error while not giving too much effort. There is no information on how he attends to fix the issue or research he has done to try to clear up the issue. Which I believe this person will not obtain a response or ineffective answers.
